# Sales Data Processor for Food Delivery Services

## Overview
This project is a Python-based solution for processing and analyzing sales data from various food delivery service providers, including Wolt, Bolt, and Foodora. The script reads CSV files from these providers, processes the data to extract meaningful insights, and outputs a summary of sales data, organized by date, provider, and location.

## Features
- **Data Aggregation**: Combines sales data from multiple providers.
- **Data Processing**: Processes and cleans data to a uniform format.
- **Summary Generation**: Generates a daily summary of sales data.
- **Clipboard Export**: Exports processed data to the clipboard for easy pasting into spreadsheet applications.
- **File Management**: Automatically deletes source CSV files after successful processing to maintain a clean workspace.
